# :fontawesome-regular-file-zipper: Snapshots
Snapshots are a _static_ type of save state in **libdebug**. They allow you to save the current state of the process in terms of registers, memory, and other process properties. Snapshots can be saved to disk as a file and loaded for future use. Finally, snapshots can be diffed to compare the differences between the state of the process at two different moments or executions.
